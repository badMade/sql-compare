## 2024-05-18 - Swap Button for Diff Tools
**Learning:** When users are comparing two text documents or files (like SQL queries), they often input the files in the reverse order of what they actually wanted, or they want to reverse the diff direction to see "what changed from B to A" instead of "A to B". Without a quick swap button, this requires manually re-selecting both files.
**Action:** Always include a "Swap" or "Reverse" button in UI tools that compare two inputs (files, text fields, branches) to reduce friction and cognitive load for the user.
