## 2024-05-24 - Precompiled finditer as lookahead skipping mechanism
**Learning:** In text parsing code (like SQL tokenization or keyword finding) that loops character-by-character to track structural state (quotes, brackets, parens), using a pre-compiled `re.finditer` pattern to jump ahead to the next *potential* match index avoids checking every single character. By only performing the linear state-tracking scan up to the skipped index to verify that the match is truly at `level == 0` and outside string literals, performance increases dramatically (O(N) character scan is bypassed entirely for irrelevant chunks).
**Action:** When optimizing tight state-tracking loops that search for specific string boundaries, prefer a two-phase approach: use `finditer` for fast regex lookahead to find the index, then catch up the state-machine up to that exact index to validate it.
