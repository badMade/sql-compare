# Metrics & Monitoring (Team-Defined Thresholds)

Track weekly and alert on regressions:
- **Change Failure Rate** and **MTTR**
- **Lead Time for Changes**
- **Code Health**: duplication %, complexity trend, style/type violations
- **Coverage** and **flaky test rate**
- **Security**: open vulnerability age; critical issue SLAs
- **Debt backlog**: count, age, % capacity spent on paydown

> Thresholds are team-defined; document and revisit quarterly.
